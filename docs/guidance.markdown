# Submission Guidance
Successful research papers and posters would focus on making headway in one of the research topics in the [Workshop description page] (https://the-ai-alliance.github.io/AAAI-25-Workshop-on-Open-Source-AI-for-Mainstream-Use/) or a similar topic. The submission should explain clearly what aspects of the research are relevant to the open source community or the open source stack.

## Research Papers
Research papers are expected to provide significant insight in the form of novel ideas related to open source and AI, as well as back up their analysis by sufficient practical evidence. 




## Research Posters


## Demonstrations
The criteria for evaluating a demo proposal are  its focus on the open source software stack, its impact on the community both in terms of the application itself and the instructive value. Demos should enable and inspire practitioners as well as showcase how specific problems related to AI can be solved within the context of open source
